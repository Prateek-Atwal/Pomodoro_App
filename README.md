# Pomodoro_App

ABOUT

This is a Pomodoro timer app. Using the Pomodoro method, one breaks his work duration into 25-minutes focus periods followed by 5-minutes breaks. Each of 
these focus periods plus a break period is called a Pomodoro session(after the tomato-shaped timer first used to test the method). For more info, check this
